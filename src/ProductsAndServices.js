        <span>gridLock offers fintech solutions that cater to two key customer segments, aiming to bridge them effectively. The first segment comprises crypto companies and token creators. We provide them with a range of services, including the ability to register their tokens with the SEC and store data on the blockchain securely. Additionally, we enable them to conduct votes among their token holders and offer strategic services to enhance their positioning in the crypto market. In essence, the tokens themselves are the product, and we facilitate the transaction process for these companies to reach investors, who form the second customer segment. Investors using our platform can track their favorite tokens, participate in token governance decisions, and invest in new tokens emerging in the crypto economy.
